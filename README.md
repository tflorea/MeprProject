## Requirements Analysis
Mepr is a platform where the user is having the possibility to see news and it’s provenance. In other words, this system will integrate multiple news APIs that will deliver different contents that could be textual or multimedia, based on user’s interests or search.

On delivering new contents, the system will search similar articles on our database to determine the provenance of the article. In case no similarity was found then a new provenance document will be created.
